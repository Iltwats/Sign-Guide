# Sign Guide 
## A travel agency website
<hr>
<p>The explorer, exploring a foreign land, snaps a picture of a sign they can't read, in a language they don't understand. The explorer uploads the picture to the service, and it responds with a translation in the customer's native language. No typing, no forms to fill outâ€”just "Here's a picture, tell me what it says."<p>
  
The website must support the following features:
  - Photo uploads
  - Extracting text from uploaded photos
  - Translating extracted text into the user's language
 
**Tools and Technology used:**
  -  Flask to build a webpage that accepts photo uploads.
  -  Use the Computer Vision API to extract text from photos,but can also identify objects in photos, find faces in photos and predict their age and gender, and more. 
  -  Use the Translator Text API to translate text extracted from photos.
  -  Deploy the application to Azure using its app services.
